Images and Vidoes in the description of a Pull Request can make it much easier for reviewers to know what they should be looking at. Let's start with the most obvious example - when it comes to design. Say that you are supposed to implement a new feature including clouds on a screen in your companies mobile app. Before the reviewers even start going through your code, it is very helpful for them if there is an image - or perhaps even better - a video of what they will review. 

How can we easily share images?

- On Windows: CTRL + Windows + S
    - It's as easy as that. The snipped image goes directly to the clipboard, it can then be pasted into the description of your PR.
- On Mac: Shift + Command + 4 
    - After selecting the area a preview will appear in the bottom right corner. Click the preview to decide where to save the screenshot. 

How can we easily share videos?

- On Windows: You have to download a third party software, or use **Game Bar**.
    - I wish there was an easier way, but it's quite tricky.
- On Mac: Shift + Command + 5. 
    - This works almost identically to the image capturing. Remember to keep the filesize to under 10MB, since GitHub restricts filesizes. 

In summary, use plenty of videos and images in your PRs, it will save you and your team a lot of time and energy :)
