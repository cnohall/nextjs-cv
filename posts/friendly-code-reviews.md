Code Reviews, it's something that we all encounter in our day to day work. Reviews are useful and necessary, both for the developer and the code. It also helps the reviewers to feel ownership for code that they didn't write themselves. 

The importance of code reviews is hard to overstate. However, there is one aspect of reviews that is easy to overlook - being friendly. Since reviews often happen between peers and within a team, the friendly attitude and tone when writing comments helps keep an open discussion and a good atmosphere.

How can we make sure that our reviews are friendly? Here are some compenents:

- Using the words thanks and please. 
- Bring up suggestions as questions. Instead of writing "change `let` for `const`", write "How about changing `let` for `const`?"
- Smileys and icons - when used in moderation - can also lead to a more friendly tone. 

In summary, as developers we all encounter code reviews, so let us use them as a opportunity to improve each others skills, the quality of the code, as well as the atmosphere in the team.
